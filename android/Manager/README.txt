To backup a DB:
- open cmdline
- make sure adb is in environment variables (the adb.exe is located in AppData/Local/Android)
- adb backup -noapk com.maxmpz.audioplayer
- Need an unpacker, like Android Backup Extractor (https://sourceforge.net/projects/adbextractor/)
- cd into extractor bin dir
- java -jar .\abe.jar unpack .\backup.ab backup.tar
- should now have folders.db
- will need to download sqlite (https://sqlite.org/2018/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3260000.zip)
- Run sqlite3.exe
- .open folders.db
- .tables
- can now perform select statements, etc.
