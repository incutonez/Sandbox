ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* LICENSE.txt
* build.xml
* proguard.cfg
* readme.md

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => poweramp_api_lib\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\org.eclipse.jdt.annotation_1.1.100.v20160418-1457.jar => poweramp_api_lib\libs\org.eclipse.jdt.annotation_1.1.100.v20160418-1457.jar
* res\ => poweramp_api_lib\src\main\res\
* src\ => poweramp_api_lib\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
