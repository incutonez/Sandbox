- create simple player images with 3 movements
-- right leg ahead
-- left leg ahead
-- both legs stopped
- create different types of AI
-- moves back and forth between a path
-- chases player
-- moves back and forth between a path but chases player when they get close
-- stationary that fires at player
-- moves away from player
- implement physics (possibly)
- have player move between screens
-- need to know player's current tile
-- also will need to know player's current castle tile (gets removed upon leaving a castle)
-- create tile files, which contain how that tile is laid out
-- dynamically create tiles/generate random enemies in there
- have player die
- create welcome screen
- create saving
- give player items
- create item screen
- create dialog
- create health bar
- split the map into block levels... block level 1 contains the path to get to dungeon 1, block level 2 for dungeon 2, etc.
-- randomize the blocks, so maybe the user would have to travel through block 8 to get to block 1
-- possibly randomize the block levels
- sword can cut non-enemy objects in the game (trees, doors, etc.)
-- objects take so many cuts before breaking
-- some objects aren't breakable
-- some non-breakable objects are secretly breakable... like a certain boulder can be broken
-- higher powered swords take less time to break these objects
-- highest powered sword can only break these secretly breakable objects
