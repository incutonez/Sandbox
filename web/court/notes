A few ideas:
- Defendant/plaintiff are color coded... maybe green and blue
- When jury votes, they turn to the color they voted for
- The judge makes the final ruling, and he will turn that color upon ruling
- when you click a person (judge, jury, defendant, plaintiff), you can view their profile...
  it'll show how many times they've served, been the judge, been the plaintiff,
  been the defendant, etc.  It also shows how long they've been on the site/
  maybe devise some sort of experience system or rating...
- There should be a centralized chatroom, where conversation between the judge,
  defendant, and plaintiff will take place... the jury will use it only when
  they are giving their ruling.  (may need to create some sort of other chat
  for them to use when deciding on the case)
- There should be an area that has all the witnesses... and a room should require
  1 witness, but that's not necessary
- Maybe add in the ability to bring friends in
- Judge/jury should be randomly selected from users online
